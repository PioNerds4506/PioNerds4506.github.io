      <div>14 brave students signed up the first year and knowing little about robotics or FRC. The team constructed a robot… out of plywood. That robot’s name was appropriately named “Woody.”
           Drive code had yet to be written as the team drove up to Duluth for the regional event. The robot didn’t move the first two matches and in the third match it drove for about 10 seconds and then tipped over. 
           At that regional event exactly zero points were scored.
