            Recycle Rush is the game for the 2015 FIRST Robotics Competition. It involves picking up and stacking totes on scoring platforms, putting pool noodles ("litter") inside recycling containers, and putting the containers on top of scoring stacks of totes.<br>

        The team made giant strides this year as they fashioned many prototypes before the final construction of the robot. 
        In the final week of the build season the team actually scrapped all of the previous designs and built an entirely new robot in 4 days. 
        An impressive feat but the team discovered that they hadn’t accounted for the weight distribution of the robot and in the first three matches of competition, the robot tipped over three times. 
        This robot earned the nickname “Tippy.” The team was not selected for elimination rounds.
