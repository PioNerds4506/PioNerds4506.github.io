            FIRST Power Up is the game for the 2018 FIRST Robotics Competition. The game is played by two alliances of three teams each. The teams are trapped in an 8-bit video game and use Power Cubes to defeat the boss.  Teams defeat the boss by owning the scale or their switch, playing power ups and climbing the scale tower.<br>

<!--          This was a year of firsts. The team came into the season with a new overall strategy.  Instead of heving the mentors being in charge of the team, the students appied for leadership
        positions so that they could really take charge with different aspects of the team. The students really took their roles seriously and had tremendous success. 
        The team took the time to completely understand the game and how to earn points.  This was the first season the team entered two regionals.
        In the Duluth regional on week 1, the team learned a lot about the game and what the robot could do.  Unfortunately, the robot broke the rope mulitple times.  Despite scoring well, the team was not selected for elimination rounds.
        In the Iowa regional, the team took what they learned in Duluth and devised a new and improved rope.  The team was selected for elimination rounds in a regional event for the first time in team history.
        This weekend was also the start of spring break and many students, including the drive team could not stay for the elimination rounds.  With only 7 team members remaining, the team rose up to the task and won the Iowa regional.
        The team then went on to competed in FRC Championship Tesla division in St. Louis.  The team competed against team from across with globe.  The team did well, but were not selected for the elimination rounds. -->
